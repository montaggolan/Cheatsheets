# crontab saves your commands in a file bearing your username in the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory.
# A daemon called crondb reads this file regularly and executes the commands at the proper times.

# You can override the mail setting by specifying MAILTO=address in the crontab file before the jobs themselves.

#The format used by crontab consists of six fields:
# minute (from 0 to 59)
# hour (from 0 to 23)
# day (from 1 to 31)
# month (from 1 to 12, or names like jan, feb, etc)
# dayofweek (from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday, or a three letter name)
# command

# fields can contain multiple values separated by commas
# a hyphen means "run every day from a through b, inclusive"
# a slash followed by a 5 means "run every fifth day" (*/5)

# this runs every day at 1:00
0 1 * * * find /tmp -atime 3 -exec rm -f {  } \;

# the following uses mailq every two days to test whether any mail is stuck in the mail queue
0 6 */2 * * mailq -v | mail -s "Stuck email in the mail queue" postmaster

# Redirect the standard output, but allow the standard error to be sent as a mail message
0 1 * * * find /run -atime 3 -exec ls -l {  } \; >> /home/mdw/log 2>&1

# add to crontab using the default editor:
crontab -e

# check crontab entries:
crontab -l

#As root, you can edit other users' crontab files by using the -u option.
crontab -u someUser -e
