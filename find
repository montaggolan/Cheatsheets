# find and delete all python bytecode-compiled files

# Find a list of all files that were modified in the last 24 hours:
find / -mtime -1 \! -type d -print # note the \! - it negates -type d, ! has to be escaped

# The -xdev option can be used to limit find's traversal to the local filesystem.

# /tmp is the dir to search
# -atime option finds files whose last access time is more than 3 days in the past
# the -exec means "execute the following command on every file we find"
# type -d selects directories
# the \! inverts the selection, just choosing all items except directories
# The curly braces tell find to "Do it to each file you find, according to the previous selection material."
# The string \; tells find that the -exec option is finished
find /tmp \! -type d -atime +3 -exec ls -l {  } \;

# This will give an ls -l listing of each file owned by username.
# If you have removed the user from /etc/passwd, use the -uid num argument instead of the -user arg
find / -user username ls
